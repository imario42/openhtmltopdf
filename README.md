# OPEN HTML TO PDF

![PDF screenshot of OpenHTMLtoPDF](screenshot.png)

## OVERVIEW
This is the community's next iteration of the [OpenHTMLtoPDF project](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf).

Open HTML to PDF is a pure-Java library for rendering a reasonable subset of well-formed XML/XHTML (and even some HTML5)
using CSS 2.1 (and later standards) for layout and formatting, outputting to PDF or images.

Use this library to generated nice looking PDF documents. But be aware that you can not throw modern HTML5+ at
this engine and expect a great result. You must special craft the HTML document for this library and 
use it's extended CSS feature like [#31](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/31) or
[#32](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/32) 
to get good results. Avoid floats near page breaks and use table layouts.

## DIFFERENCES WITH FLYING SAUCER

+ Proper support for generating PDF/A standards compliant PDFs.
+ New, faster renderer means this project can be several times faster for very large documents.
+ Better support for CSS3 transforms.
+ Automatic visual regression testing of PDFs, with many end-to-end tests.
+ Ability to insert pages for cut-off content.
+ Built-in plugins for SVG and MathML.
+ Font fallback support.
+ Limited support for RTL and bi-directional documents.
+ On the negative side, no support for OpenType fonts.
+ Footnote support.
+ Much more. See changelog below.
